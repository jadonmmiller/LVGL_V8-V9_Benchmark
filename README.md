# LVGL V8-V9  Benchmark
## Benchmarking LVGL V8 vs V9 on an STM32 board!

This repo contains branches for LVGL versions, each containing a very simple benchmarking demo for my STM32 BlackPill board. Its purpose it to illustrate the speed differences between versions of LVGL.

**These files (Version 8.3) resulted in a weighted FPS of 31 and an opa speed of 87%.**
